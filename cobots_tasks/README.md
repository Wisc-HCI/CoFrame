# cobots_tasks
Cobots is an education system developed for collaborative manufacturing robots (e.g., Universal Robots, Franka Emika) with the goal of overlaying an expert's view of a task onto the operator's understanding.

This package provides several tasks implemented for experiments and demos when using the cobots system.
