# cobots_ros
Cobots is an education system developed for collaborative manufacturing robots (e.g., Universal Robots, Franka Emika) with the goal of overlaying an expert's view of a task onto the operator's understanding.

This is the ROS meta-package for the Cobots ROS system. To see the system overview check out the repository [README](../README.md).
