# Expert View Dashbaord
Expert View Dashboard (EvD) is an educational environment used to train operators for collaborative robotic workcells. Our system overlays visual and textual expert thought on top of the physical workcell (through a Microsoft Hololens app) and on the authoring environment (through a web app deployed to a tablet).
