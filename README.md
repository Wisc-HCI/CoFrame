# cobots_ros
Cobots is an education system developed for collaborative manufacturing robots (e.g., Universal Robots, Franka Emika) with the goal of overlaying an expert's view of a task onto the operator's understanding.

These packages compose the ROS backend for the Cobots project.

- [cobots_ros](./cobots_ros/README.md): ROS meta-package
- [cobots_core](./cobots_core/README.md): ROS Server backend
- [cobots_tasks](./cobots_tasks/README.md): Specific tasks for experiments and demos

For the front-end implementation:
