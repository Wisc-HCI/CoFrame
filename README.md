# evd_authoring_app

EvD is an education system developed for collaborative manufacturing robots (e.g., Universal Robots, Franka Emika) with the goal of overlaying an expert's view of a task onto the operator's understanding.

This package contains a React Web App that serves as the authoring environment for the EvD system. The ideal deployment is to a tablet device in landscape mode.
