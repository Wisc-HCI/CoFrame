'''
ThingPlaceholder acts as substitute to Things in EvD. If you are familiar with Promises
from javascript, this is similar.

When machines operate, they produce things according to a thing_type. Until they do, there
is no actual thing. However, in order to program evd we need to explicitly represent a
node that acts as a thing beforehand.
