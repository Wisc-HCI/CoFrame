# evd_ros_core
EvD is an education system developed for collaborative manufacturing robots (e.g., Universal Robots, Franka Emika) with the goal of overlaying an expert's view of a task onto the operator's understanding.

This package is the ROS backend server that runs an implemented task.

To see the system overview check out the repository [README](../README.md).
